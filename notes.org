#+title: Notes

Lox is small, high level scripting language

Dynamically typed meaning that type checking is done at runtime :(

Static type checking will be done later.

Automatic memory management so no allocating or freeing memory
We'll be writing a garbage collector

Data types that will be used:
- Booleans
- Numbers (i.e. not ints but double floats)
  - ints
  - decimals
- Strings
- Nil (basically null) (would be worth banning if statically typed)

+-*/
With also unary -

We will also use + to concatenate strings

comparison
<, <=, >, >=

== and !=

logical operators: !_, and, or

They will aslo be short circuit

An expression followed by a ; becomes a statement

A block is a case where a single statement is expected you can put multiple:

{
stmt1;
stmt2;
}

Declaring variables are done with the var keyword

if else

while

for

function calls:

functionName(arg1, arg2, arg3);

functionName();

fun funName(arg1, arg2){

}

*Parameter  v Argument*

Argument: value you pass to a function when you call it. the concrete thing you supply.

Parameter: is the abstract variable that is the stand in
